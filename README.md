## _FRONT-END PROJECT - IRONHACK_

## Features

![Start Screen](./images/start-screen.png)

This is the Conclusion Project of the Second Module of Bootcamp, made at Ironhack in São Paulo/Brazil.
We use Javascript, React JS, CSS3 and HTML5, in all the work.
With requests made to the API “The Meal DB”, we were able to use recipes, images and many other data.
It was a great learning experience, as well as great fun with the recipes we got to know.


Project developed by Juliana Madeira and Jessica Nonato.
